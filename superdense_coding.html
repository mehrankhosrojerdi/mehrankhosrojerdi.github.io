        <h2>Superdense coding</h2>
        <p> 
            Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows a sender to send two 
            classical bits of information to another user by only utilizing one qubit. Here I have 
            a plan to explain the story behind this protocol in simple words.  
            
            <h4>Summary of superdense coding</h4>  
            1) Alice and Bob, who are our users, share an EPR pair.<br>   
            2) Alice wants to share two classical bits with Bob (this is the goal).<br>   
            3) Alice encodes two classical bits of information by a qubit.<br>
            4) There is a Quantum Channel between Alice and Bob.  <br>
            5) Alice is sending the encoded qubit, and Bob decodes this to get Alice's two classical bits.<br>
            <br>
            <h4>0s step: Make EPR pair</h4>
            The EPR pair between Alice and Bob is described by: 
            $$\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(|00\rangle + |11\rangle\right)$$
            which means the first qubit belongs to Alice and the second qubit belongs to Bob. Here Alice will encode her qubit
            with respect to the classical bits that she wants to send. We assume that \(b_{0}b_{1}\)  are two classical bits that 
            Alice wants to send them to Bob. There are four situations here that we want to describe them:<br>
            <br>
            <h4>1st step: Alice Operation and Encoding</h4>
            If \(b_{0}b_{1} = 00\), it means that Alice did nothing with EPR pair and the formation of EPR pair after alice operation 
            is like \(\left(|00\rangle + |11\rangle\right)/{\sqrt{2}}\) <br>
            If \(b_{0}b_{1} = 01\), it means that Alice did X transportation or NOT Gate on EPR pair which its formation after Alice operation is like
            \(\left(|10\rangle + |01\rangle\right)/{\sqrt{2}}\).<br>
            If \(b_{0}b_{1} = 10\), it means that Alice did Z transportation or Phase change on EPR pair and its formation after Alice operation is like 
            \( \left(|00\rangle - |11\rangle\right)/{\sqrt{2}}\).<br>
            If \(b_{0}b_{1} = 11\) , it means that Alice did XZ transportation on EPR pair and its formation after Alice operation is like 
            \( \left(|10\rangle - |01\rangle\right)/{\sqrt{2}}\) .<br>
            <br>
            <h4>2nd step: Send qubit from Alice to Bob through the Quantum Channel</h4>
            In this protocol we assume that there is a channel between two users (Alice and Bob) and now Alice send her qubit to Bob.
            <h4>3rd step: Bob Operation and Decode the information</h4>
            Bob Operation consist of by a \(4*4\) Matrix which is a Hadamard gate followed by a NOT operator.<br>
            <br>
            
            <h4>Superdense coding in summary</h4>
